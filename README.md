### About
Our final project as part of the first degree in computer science deals with the analysis, design and construction of a website for managing trade in digital assets. <br>
Digital asset trading deals with buying, selling and managing different assets from different categories using digital platforms on the internet. <br>
This includes event tickets, service subscriptions, digital products and more. Digital assets can be bought and sold quickly and conveniently through systems and websites, and there is no need for physical meetings. <br>
The field offers great flexibility and the possibility of adding digital assets to an investment portfolio or for personal enjoyment. <br>

### Goals

* Creating a convenient and friendly user interface that helps users navigate the system, perform actions easily and receive information in a clear and structured way.
* Recruitment and management of digital assets that allow users to manage, buy and sell digital assets easily and simply, while ensuring transparency and reliability in the trading process.
